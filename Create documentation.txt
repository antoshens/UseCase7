User:

Here is the code that is written in C#10:
namespace UseCase7
{
    public class Student
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public int Grade { get; set; }
        public bool Exceptional { get; set; }
        public bool HonorRoll { get; set; }
        public bool Passed { get; set; }
    }

    public class StudentConverter
    {
        public List<Student> ConvertStudents(List<Student> students)
        {
            return students.Select(student =>
            {
                var result = new Student
                {
                    Name = student.Name,
                    Age = student.Age,
                    Grade = student.Grade
                };

                if (student.Grade > 90)
                {
                    if (student.Age < 21)
                    {
                        result.Exceptional = true;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        result.HonorRoll = true;
                    }
                }
                else if (student.Grade > 70)
                {
                    result.Passed = true;
                }
                else
                {
                    result.Passed = false;
                }

                return result;
            }).ToList();
        }
    }

}

And the unit tests that were written for this code using XUnit testing framework and Should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest tests naming pattern:

namespace UseCase7.Tests.StudentConverter

    public class StudentConverter_Positive_Tests
    {

            var students = new List<Student> { new Student { Age = 22, Grade = 91 } };
            var result = _studentConverter.ConvertStudents(students);

            Assert.Single(result);
            Assert.True(result[0].HonorRoll);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Should_SetExceptionalTrue_When_AgeBelow21AndGradeAbove90()

            var result = _studentConverter.ConvertStudents(students);

            Assert.Single(result);
            Assert.True(result[0].Exceptional);
        }

            var result = _studentConverter.ConvertStudents(students);

            Assert.Single(result);
            Assert.True(result[0].Passed);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Should_SetPassedFalse_When_Grade70OrBelow()

            var result = _studentConverter.ConvertStudents(students);

            Assert.Single(result);
            Assert.False(result[0].Passed);
        }
    }
}

namespace UseCase7.Tests.StudentConverter
{
    public class StudentConverter_Negative_Tests
    {
        private readonly UseCase7.StudentConverter _studentConverter;

        public StudentConverter_Negative_Tests()
        {
            _studentConverter = new UseCase7.StudentConverter();
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Should_ReturnEmptyList_When_InputListIsEmpty()
        {
            var students = new List<Student>();
            var result = _studentConverter.ConvertStudents(students);

            Assert.Empty(result);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void Should_ThrowException_When_InputIsNull()
        {

        }
    }
}

Just remember it

ChatGPT:

Alright, I've reviewed the C# code you've provided, which pertains to a StudentConverter class and its associated unit tests using the XUnit framework.

How can I assist you further with it?


User:

And also remember this peace of code also written in C#10:

namespace UseCase7
{
    public class Player
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public int Experience { get; set; }
        public List<int> Skills { get; set; }
    }

    public class PlayerAnalyzer
    {
        public double CalculateScore(List<Player> players)
        {
            double score = 0;

            foreach (var player in players)
            {
                double skillsAverage = player.Skills.Sum() / (double)player.Skills.Count;
                double contribution = player.Age * player.Experience * skillsAverage;

                if (player.Age < 18)
                {
                    contribution *= 0.5;
                }

                if (player.Experience > 10)
                {
                    contribution *= 1.2;
                }

                score += contribution;
            }

            return score;
        }
    }

}

And the unit tests that were written using XUnit framework along with XUnit Fixture approach, IDisposable pattern and Should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest test naming pattern:

namespace UseCase7.Tests.PlayerAnalyzer
{
    public class PlayerAnalyzerFixture : IDisposable
    {

ChatGPT:

I've reviewed the second set of code you've shared which deals with a PlayerAnalyzer class and its unit tests using XUnit. This class is used to calculate a score for a list of players based on their age, experience, and skills. The unit tests are organized using the IClassFixture and IDisposable patterns, a common way to manage setup and cleanup for unit test classes in xUnit.

Is there a specific question or area you'd like to focus on regarding this code?

README - UseCase7 Tests
Test Description
The UseCase7 testing suite is primarily focused on two main classes: StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer. The StudentConverter class is designed to convert student data, especially by marking specific attributes such as being exceptional or on the honor roll, based on their age and grade. Its tests ensure that the conversion logic functions as expected. The PlayerAnalyzer class, on the other hand, evaluates player data to calculate a score based on a player's age, experience, and skillset. Through its tests, it is ensured that the score computation is accurate, catering to various edge cases and scenarios.

The tests have been categorized into Positive and Negative tests. Positive tests confirm the expected behavior under normal or beneficial circumstances, while negative tests ensure robustness by checking behavior under unintended or harmful inputs. Both of these categories are further reinforced by using the xUnit framework, leveraging features such as IClassFixture for test setup and IDisposable for cleanup, ensuring that each test runs in a fresh state.

How to Run Tests Locally
Prerequisites: Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

.NET SDK (Version recommended: .NET 5.0 or later)
A preferred code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
Restore Dependencies:
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
Running the Tests:
Navigate to the test project directory (UseCase7.Tests) and execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
dotnet test
Review Results: After the tests have completed running, the results will be displayed in the terminal. Look for any failures or errors and refer to the test logs for detailed information.

That's it! You've successfully run the tests locally.
